Track 3rd Party & Approvals
A UX Overhaul for Material Receipts
1. Project Overview

Goals: 
Streamline MR workflows across Field Engineers → Providers → Finance while ensuring audit trails from Finance Team and compliance for internal Company teams.
Finance needed better tools to validate MRs (approved/rejected) before payment.

Role: UX Validator/Analyst (identified gaps via stakeholder notes and heuristic evaluation).

2. Methodology

Benchmarking: 5 competitor analyses informed patterns (e.g., status tracking).

Stakeholder Notes: 
Parsed conversations with Stakeholders: Business (Finance) & Product Owner to flag ambiguities, validate all requirements, api usages, previous experience with current app.
Mapped actions per user type.
Highlighted friction in provider/finance handoffs
Collaboration: Bridged gaps between devs and Product Owner to fit time requirements, technology capabilities, best methodology, solve all questions that could have remained.
Heuristic Review: Highlighted navigation issues (breadcrumbs), consistency (language), feedback loops (notifications) new Material Receipts hierachy requirements. MR for each Proyect, Well & Stage.
Findings & Key Improvements Proposed

Language: Mixed Spanish/English terms caused confusion (e.g., "Proveedor" vs. "Provider").
Navigation: Missing "Go back" buttons disrupted multi-step workflows 
Unexistent breadcrumbs to Well selection screens.
Redesign status indicators (progress percentages avoided because of time dev constrains)
User Flow: Map MR lifecycle (creation → approval → closure) with notification touchpoints.
The solution
3. UI/UX Improvements
Dashboard required to be Role-Specific
Clearer role-based UI paths (e.g., hyperlinked breadcrumbs for Wells).
Field Engineers: Quick MR PDF generation with pre-filled forms.
Finance: MR validation panel with fast search options.
Reduced manual errors in MR handoffs (Finance could trace MRs to Providers).
Confirmation Alerts: Notify Providers upon MR acceptance by Finance.
(mail whole team)

Backend Logic

Auto-remove Providers post-payment (flagged as a requirement).
Dual-signature enforcement in PDF MRs (automated by active user).


Why This Matters

Holistic View: Ties UI improvements (e.g., breadcrumbs) to user roles (e.g., Finance needs quick access).
Business Impact: Shows how UX reduces workflow bottlenecks (e.g., payment delays).
